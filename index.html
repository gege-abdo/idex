  <div class="description"><b>A star</b>is type of astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically,
     the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names.
     Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.

   <div class="description"><p>For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively.
      The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.
</p>
<p>A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements.
   When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process. The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted. In some cases, it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core.
    As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars. Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or if it is sufficiently massive a black hole.
</p>
<p>Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits.
  When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

<h1 class="title">Units of measurement</h1>
<div class="description"><p>Although stellar parameters can be expressed in SI units or CGS units,
   it is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun.
    In 2015, the IAU defined a set of nominal solar values (defined as SI constants, without uncertainties) which can be used for quoting stellar parameters:<br>
nominal solar luminosity:<em>	L⊙ = 3.828 × 10^26 W</em><br>
nominal solar radius	<em>R⊙ = 6.957 × 10^8 m</em>
</p>
<p>The solar mass M⊙ was not explicitly defined by the IAU due to the large relative uncertainty (10^−4) of the Newtonian gravitational constant G.
   However, since the product of the Newtonian gravitational constant and solar mass together (GM⊙) has been determined to much greater precision,
    the IAU defined the nominal solar mass parameter to be:<br>

nominal solar mass parameter:	GM⊙ = 1.3271244 × 10^20 m^3 s^−2
</p>
<p>However, one can combine the nominal solar mass parameter with the most recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 10^30 kg.
   Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties,
   the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.
</p>
<p> lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles).
   In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m
